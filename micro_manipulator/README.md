### OPAM, an Open source, 3D printed Low-cost Micro-Manipulator For Single Cell Manipulation
* This robotic arm has three axis(x,y and z) with adjustable angle between z axis and x,y plane
* The three axces were driven by independent stepper motors, respectively, with a minimum step of only 3 μm.
* The 20-μl microliter syringe was fitted into a syringe housing and driven by a fourth stepper motor,
