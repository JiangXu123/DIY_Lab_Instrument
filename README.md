# DIY Lab Instrument
This repo contains some arduino codes and designs I wrote and also corresponding 3D design(stl file) and circuit for some of my designs of the DIY lab instruments 

The UV meter is used to roughly measure the UV radiation with range depends on the type of the sensor. 

The micromanipulator is a home-made robotic arm that can handle single cell under the microscope, it costs no more than $150 but it actually CAN handle single suspension cell. I will post my thoughts and why it should work in principle and the footage recording how it works, also the problem with the present design. I think it will be fairly useful if you have some thoughts on single cell minipulation but on a tight budget.
